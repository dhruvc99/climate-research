This repository contains code and results from some research I did with [Prof. McKinnon|https://karenamckinnon.github.io/group.html] towards the end of my undergraduate degree at UCLA. We analyzed how land-atmosphere interactions may be related to heatwaves events in North America using observations (FLUXNET) and reanalysis data (ERA5, MERRA2).
